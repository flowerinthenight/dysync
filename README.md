## Overview

`dysync` is a tool for syncing [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables between two accounts.

When role ARN is provided (either by `--src-rolearn` or `--dst-rolearn`, this tool will attempt to assume that role using the provided key/secret combination.

By default, this tool will attempt to do a full sync, meaning, any records in dst that don't exist in src will be deleted. To override, set `--copy-only` to true, in which case, it will only do a copy. This option only works when both `--id` and `--sk` are empty (scan table), otherwise, if either `--id` or `--sk` is set (or both), it will do a copy only, not full sync.

At the moment, this tool only supports string-based hash and range keys (when using `--id` and/or `--sk` flags).

Note that this tool uses the Scan AWS API which is expensive and really slow for huge tables. You've been warned.
